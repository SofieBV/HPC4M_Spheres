# HPC4M_Spheres

### High performance computing for hard sphere modelling

This project aims at simulating particles collision for a hard sphere model. This GitHub provides the code for a serial and parallel implementation.

To run the serial code: 
Code/main_serial.py

To run the parallel code: 
Code/main_parallel.py

Both python files uses the code/function_hardsphere.py

Outputs of the simulation can be found in: 
Code/outputs
