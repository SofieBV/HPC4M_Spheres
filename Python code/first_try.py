General steps: 

commenting code really well 

write the code in serial: 
- square shape starting with 10 
- create the heap structure (can just be called in python)
- colisions between walls and colisions between particles 

or initialise heap structure then compute colisions and build the heap structure 
check if the code works properly (run it backward and see if we get the same initial conditions)
parralelise the code and do fun things
